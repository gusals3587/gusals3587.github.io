![Feynman Lectures Exercise book cover](/assets/book_covers/FLP_exercise.jpg){: width="200"}

This is approximately a 1000 problems designed as a supplement to the Feynman Lectures On Physics, I will post my personal collection of solutions, but due to fear of misuse, I may implement an obfuscation scheme to have some barrier against "dishonest" students.

However, I think the first few chapters are safe since there's already a partial solution manual available (if you know where to look)

I won't accept any request for further solutions other than the problems posted here.
I *may* help people that  
1. don't have access to a professional faculty  
2. shown sign(s) of effort to solve the problem  
3. confused about a material that I understand
4. not completely hopeless

A prime candidate would be an ambitious teenager with a disappointing physics teacher. As I have been in those shoes (and still is with the ambitious part), I may help you.. if I'm not too busy.

Anyway, here's the solutions

Chapter 1.

Chapter 2. [2.9](/FLP/2-9 solution), [2.19](/FLP/2-19 solution)
